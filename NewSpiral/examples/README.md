# AutoCAD MCP Examples

These examples show you exactly what AutoCAD MCP can do and how to use it in real projects.

## üè† Example 1: Building Floor Plan
**File:** `building_floor_plan.py`

**What it does:**
- Automatically draws a complete building floor plan
- Creates exterior walls, interior walls, doors, and windows
- Perfect for architects or anyone doing building design

**Run it:**
```bash
python examples/building_floor_plan.py
```

**What you'll see in AutoCAD:**
- A 40' x 30' building layout
- 4 rooms divided by interior walls  
- Door and window locations marked
- All drawn automatically in seconds!

## üîß Example 2: Mechanical Parts
**File:** `mechanical_part.py`

**What it does:**
- Creates precise mechanical parts like brackets and gears
- Shows how to make complex 3D shapes with exact dimensions
- Perfect for engineers and manufacturers

**Run it:**
```bash
python examples/mechanical_part.py
```

**Choose from:**
1. **Mounting Bracket** - L-shaped bracket with mounting holes and ribs
2. **Gear** - Circular gear with teeth and center hole

**What you'll see:**
- Precise mechanical parts ready for manufacturing
- All dimensions and features created programmatically

## üìä Example 3: Data-Driven Design  
**File:** `data_driven_design.py`

**What it does:**
- Reads data from lists/files and creates drawings automatically
- Like "mail merge" but for CAD drawings
- Perfect for repetitive designs or large projects

**Run it:**
```bash
python examples/data_driven_design.py
```

**Choose from:**
1. **Pipe Layout** - Industrial piping system with different materials and sizes
2. **Furniture Layout** - Office furniture arrangement

**What you'll see:**
- Complete layouts created from data
- Each piece labeled with specifications
- Reports generated automatically

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Make sure AutoCAD 2025 is running** with a drawing open
2. **Make sure the MCP server is running** (see main instructions)
3. **Choose an example** and run it
4. **Watch AutoCAD draw automatically!**

## üí° Real-World Applications

### Architecture & Construction
- Floor plans from room data
- Building layouts from spreadsheets
- Repetitive elements (windows, doors, structural members)

### Manufacturing & Engineering  
- Parts from specification sheets
- Product variations from parameters
- Assembly drawings from parts lists

### Infrastructure
- Piping layouts from flow diagrams
- Electrical schematics from connection data
- Site plans from survey data

### Repetitive Tasks
- Drawing 100 similar parts
- Creating variations of a design
- Batch processing multiple drawings

## üéØ The Big Picture

Instead of:
- ‚ùå Manually drawing each line, circle, and shape
- ‚ùå Repeating the same steps hundreds of times  
- ‚ùå Making errors in repetitive work
- ‚ùå Spending days on drawings

You get:
- ‚úÖ Automatic drawing generation
- ‚úÖ Perfect precision every time
- ‚úÖ Designs from data (Excel, databases, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Hours of work done in seconds

## üîÑ What's Next?

After running these examples, you can:

1. **Modify them** for your specific needs
2. **Combine techniques** from different examples
3. **Add your own data sources** (Excel files, databases, APIs)
4. **Create your own automation scripts**

The AutoCAD MCP gives you the building blocks - these examples show you how to use them!
