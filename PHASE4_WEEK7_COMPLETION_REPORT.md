**MCP Server Integration:**
- Added all Phase 4 tools to enhanced MCP server with lazy loading
- Implemented helper methods for component initialization
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tools

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Improvements

**Lazy Loading Pattern:**
```python
def _get_test_generator(self):
    """Get test generator instance with lazy loading."""
    if not hasattr(self, '_test_generator'):
        from ..testing.test_generators import TestGenerator
        self._test_generator = TestGenerator()
    return self._test_generator
```

**Optional Dependency Handling:**
```python
try:
    import psutil
    HAS_PSUTIL = True
except ImportError:
    psutil = None
    HAS_PSUTIL = False
```

**Template-Based Test Generation:**
- AST parsing for function and class discovery
- Intelligent parameter value generation based on naming conventions
- AutoCAD API call detection for mock requirement identification
- Template rendering with proper import management

### Quality Assurance Results

**Import Testing:** ✅ All modules import successfully  
**Component Integration:** ✅ Cross-component dependencies resolved  
**Dependency Handling:** ✅ Optional dependencies gracefully handled  
**MCP Tool Registration:** ✅ All 4 new tools properly registered  
**Backward Compatibility:** ✅ All existing functionality preserved
