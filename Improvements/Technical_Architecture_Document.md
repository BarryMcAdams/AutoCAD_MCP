### 2.2 Current MCP Integration Gap
The existing MCP server (`src/mcp_server.py`) implements only 7 basic drawing functions:
- `draw_line()` - Basic line drawing
- `draw_circle()` - Circle creation
- `extrude_profile()` - 2D to 3D extrusion
- `revolve_profile()` - Profile revolution
- `list_entities()` - Entity enumeration
- `get_entity_info()` - Entity inspection
- `server_status()` - Connection status

**Critical Gap:** 45,300+ lines of sophisticated algorithmic code remain inaccessible through the MCP interface.

### 2.3 Missing Critical Component: C# .NET Support
Professional AutoCAD development primarily uses C# with the .NET API (ObjectARX). The current codebase lacks:
- C# code generation capabilities
- .NET API integration patterns
- ObjectARX automation templates
- C# debugging and profiling tools

This gap prevents enterprise adoption by professional AutoCAD developers who work exclusively in C#/.NET environments.
