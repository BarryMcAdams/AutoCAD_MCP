### 11. [!] Complete implementation in utils.py:629
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: '# Method 3: Direct array passing (some COM interfaces accept this)'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\utils.py:629

### 12. [!] Complete implementation in ai_code_generator.py:1339
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: '+ '\n\n# Error handling\ntry:\n    pass\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f"Error: {e}")''. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\ai_features\ai_code_generator.py:1339

   - **Time Investment**: 45-90 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: 163 structural issues compound complexity. Fix architecture before adding features.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Clean architecture is the foundation of sustainable development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     Long function def create_text_annotation(self, insertion_point: List[float], text_content: str, in dimensioning.py
     Long function def create_leader_with_text(self, start_point: List[float], end_point: List[float], in dimensioning.py

   - **Priority**: LOW | **Category**: Project Management
   - **Time Investment**: 10-15 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: What gets measured gets managed. Session handoff requires comprehensive tracking.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Tracking is the foundation of continuous improvement
