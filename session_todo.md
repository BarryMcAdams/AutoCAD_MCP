     - Test src/ai_features/automated_code_reviewer.py (new_feature)
     - Test src/algorithms/lscm.py (new_feature)
     - Test src/code_generation/validation_engine.py (new_feature)

### 15. [H] Validate and optimize algorithmic implementations

### 17. [L] Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md with detailed session progress and insights
   - **Priority**: LOW | **Category**: Project Management
   - **Time Investment**: 10-15 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: What gets measured gets managed. Session handoff requires comprehensive tracking.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Tracking is the foundation of continuous improvement
