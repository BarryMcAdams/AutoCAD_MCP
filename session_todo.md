   - **Development Wisdom**: Security is not negotiable in professional development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     automated_code_reviewer.py:695
     automated_code_reviewer.py:696
     automated_code_reviewer.py:865

### 2. [!] Fix security vulnerability: Dangerous exec() usage in 1 locations
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Security
   - **Time Investment**: 30-60 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: Security vulnerabilities are project-killing risks that must be eliminated immediately.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Security is not negotiable in professional development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     automated_code_reviewer.py:883

### 3. [!] Fix security vulnerability: Hardcoded secrets in 3 locations
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Security
   - **Time Investment**: 60-120 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: Security vulnerabilities are project-killing risks that must be eliminated immediately.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Security is not negotiable in professional development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     code_example_generator.py:434
     code_example_generator.py:436
     code_example_generator.py:438

### 4. [!] Complete implementation in connection_manager.py:259
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: 'pass'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\enhanced_autocad\connection_manager.py:259

### 5. [!] Complete implementation in enhanced_wrapper.py:294
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: 'pass'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\enhanced_autocad\enhanced_wrapper.py:294

### 6. [!] Complete implementation in performance_optimization.py:537
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: 'pass'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\enterprise\performance_optimization.py:537

### 7. [H] Create comprehensive tests for recently modified components
   - **Priority**: HIGH | **Category**: Testing
   - **Time Investment**: 45-90 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: 5 recent changes require validation. Untested changes are landmines.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Test immediately after implementation while context is fresh
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - Test commands/handoff.py (new_feature)
     - Test commands/pickup.py (new_feature)
     - Test src/testing/mock_autocad.py (new_feature)

### 8. [H] Validate and optimize algorithmic implementations
   - **Priority**: HIGH | **Category**: Algorithm Validation
   - **Time Investment**: 60-120 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Project is in algorithm development phase. TRUTH: Algorithms require mathematical validation.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Algorithmic correctness is more important than algorithmic optimization

### 9. [M] Refactor architectural issues to improve maintainability
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM | **Category**: Refactoring
   - **Time Investment**: 45-90 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: 15 structural issues compound complexity. Fix architecture before adding features.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Clean architecture is the foundation of sustainable development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     Long function def analyze_surface_mesh(entity) -> Dict[str, Any]: in utils.py (123 lines)
     Long function def AddPolyFaceMesh(self, vertices, faces): in utils.py (101 lines)
     Long function def _assess_code_quality(self, code: str, request: CodeGenerationRequest) -> Dict[str, float]: in ai_code_generator.py (140 lines)

### 10. [L] Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md with detailed session progress and insights
   - **Priority**: LOW | **Category**: Project Management
   - **Time Investment**: 10-15 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: What gets measured gets managed. Session handoff requires comprehensive tracking.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Tracking is the foundation of continuous improvement

## Development Wisdom Principles Applied
- PRINCIPLE 1: 'Finish What You Started' - Actual incomplete work prioritized
- PRINCIPLE 2: 'Address Critical Flaws Immediately' - Real security issues first
- PRINCIPLE 3: 'Validate Recent Changes' - Test actual modifications
- PRINCIPLE 4: 'TODO Comments Are Commitments' - Honor real promises
- PRINCIPLE 5: 'Testing Is Insurance' - Address real coverage gaps
- PRINCIPLE 6: 'Parse Handoff Intelligence' - Honor previous insights
- PRINCIPLE 7: 'Architecture Before Features' - Structure first
- PRINCIPLE 8: 'Document Decisions' - Capture architectural wisdom
- PRINCIPLE 9: 'Validate Integration' - System cohesion
- PRINCIPLE 10: 'Honor The Phase' - Phase-appropriate development
- PRINCIPLE 11: 'Measure What Matters' - Comprehensive tracking
