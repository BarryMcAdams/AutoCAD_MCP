### 10. [!] Complete implementation in utils.py:303
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: 'pass'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\utils.py:303

### 11. [!] Complete implementation in utils.py:594
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: '# Method 3: Direct array passing (some COM interfaces accept this)'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work

### 14. [H] Execute comprehensive testing expansion plan per previous session
   - **Priority**: HIGH | **Category**: Testing
   - **Time Investment**: 90-150 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Previous session identified this as the next major milestone. TRUTH: Testing expansion is project maturity.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Testing expansion should happen in phases, not all at once

### 15. [H] Implement enterprise-grade testing framework expansion
   - **Priority**: HIGH | **Category**: Testing Framework
   - **Time Investment**: 120-180 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Project is in testing expansion phase. TRUTH: Testing phases require focus and completion.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Complete each development phase fully before moving to the next

### 16. [M] Refactor architectural issues to improve maintainability
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM | **Category**: Refactoring
   - **Time Investment**: 45-90 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: 153 structural issues compound complexity. Fix architecture before adding features.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Clean architecture is the foundation of sustainable development
   - **Implementation Details**:
     Long function def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> Any: in decorators.py
     Long function def create_linear_dimension(self, start_point: List[float], end_point: List[float], in dimensioning.py
     Long function def create_angular_dimension(self, vertex_point: List[float], first_point: List[float], in dimensioning.py

### 17. [L] Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md with detailed session progress and insights
   - **Priority**: LOW | **Category**: Project Management
   - **Time Investment**: 10-15 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: TRUTH: What gets measured gets managed. Session handoff requires comprehensive tracking.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Tracking is the foundation of continuous improvement
