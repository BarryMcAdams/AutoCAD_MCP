   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\utils.py:303
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Resolution**: Fixed bare except clause with proper exception handling. Changed 'except: pass' to 'except (ValueError, IndexError, TypeError) as e:' with appropriate logging. This prevents silent exception swallowing and provides better error visibility.

### 11. [x] Complete implementation in utils.py:594
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: '# Method 3: Direct array passing (some COM interfaces accept this)'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\utils.py:594
   - **Status**: RESOLVED

   - **Priority**: CRITICAL | **Category**: Implementation
   - **Time Investment**: 20-45 minutes
   - **Strategic Rationale**: Incomplete implementation: ''suggested_fix': f"try:\n    {call['name']}\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Handle COM error\n    pass"'. TRUTH: Unfinished code is technical debt that compounds daily.
   - **Development Wisdom**: Finish what you started before beginning new work
   - **Location**: C:\Users\barrya\source\repos\AutoCAD_MCP\src\ai_features\automated_code_reviewer.py:668
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Resolution**: Fixed incomplete error handling template in suggested fix.

See `architectural_refactoring_analysis.md` for complete analysis, proposed architecture, and implementation plan.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     Long function def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> Any: in decorators.py
     Long function def create_linear_dimension(self, start_point: List[float], end_point: List[float], in dimensioning.py
     Long function def create_angular_dimension(self, vertex_point: List[float], first_point: List[float], in dimensioning.py

### 15. [x] Update PROJECT_TRACKER.md with detailed session progress and insights
   - **Priority**: LOW | **Category**: Project Management
