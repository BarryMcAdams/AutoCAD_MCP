### Version: 1.0
### Date: July 22, 2025

### Product Mission
The AutoCAD MCP Server is a robust Python-based protocol enabling programmatic automation of AutoCAD 2025 for advanced 3D CAD workflows. It targets CAD designers focused on 3D operations, providing AI-assisted scripting via VS Code to automate tasks like unfolding surfaces for CNC and layout dimensioning. By bridging AutoCAD with modern development tools, it reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and accelerates design iterations.

### Target Audience
CAD professionals in engineering, manufacturing, and architecture using AutoCAD 2025 on Windows, who require custom utilities for 3D-to-2D transformations and presentation automation.

### Why It Matters
Manual 3D manipulations are time-intensive and error-prone. This server empowers users to create precise, extensible plugins, fostering productivity in CNC fabrication and technical documentation.
