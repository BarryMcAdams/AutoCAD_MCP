# Education & Training Use Cases

This guide covers how to use the AutoCAD MCP Server for educational institutions and training programs.

## üéì Educational Workflows

### 1. Interactive CAD Learning Modules

**Scenario**: Create hands-on learning experiences for CAD students

**Steps**:
1. Set up guided tutorials with step-by-step instructions
2. Use AI-powered feedback to help students learn
3. Provide real-time error detection and correction
4. Track student progress and competency development

**Example**:
```python
# Create interactive tutorial
tutorial = mcp_client.call_tool("create_learning_module", {
    "topic": "3d_modeling_basics",
    "skill_level": "beginner",
    "duration": "2_hours",
    "learning_objectives": [
        "create_basic_solids",
        "apply_boolean_operations",
        "add_dimensions"
    ]
})

# Monitor student progress
progress = mcp_client.call_tool("track_student_progress", {
    "student_id": "student_001",
    "tutorial": tutorial,
    "completion_criteria": {"accuracy": 85, "time_limit": 120}
})
```

### 2. Automated Skill Assessment

**Scenario**: Evaluate student CAD proficiency objectively

**Steps**:
1. Design assessment tasks covering key competencies
2. Set up automated grading criteria
3. Provide detailed feedback on student performance
4. Generate competency reports for instructors

**Example**:
```python
# Create skill assessment
assessment = mcp_client.call_tool("create_skill_assessment", {
    "competencies": [
        "2d_drafting",
        "3d_modeling", 
        "dimensioning",
        "layer_management"
    ],
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "time_limit": 90
})

# Evaluate student submission
results = mcp_client.call_tool("evaluate_student_work", {
    "submission": "student_project.dwg",
    "assessment_criteria": assessment,
    "provide_feedback": True,
    "rubric": "industry_standard"
})
```

### 3. Collaborative Design Projects

**Scenario**: Enable team-based learning with real-world design challenges

**Steps**:
1. Set up multi-user collaborative environments
2. Assign roles and responsibilities to team members
3. Provide project management and tracking tools
4. Facilitate peer review and feedback processes

**Example**:
```python
# Setup collaborative project
project = mcp_client.call_tool("create_collaborative_project", {
    "project_type": "mechanical_assembly",
    "team_size": 4,
    "roles": ["project_manager", "designer", "analyst", "documenter"],
    "deliverables": ["3d_model", "drawings", "analysis", "presentation"]
})

# Manage team collaboration
collaboration = mcp_client.call_tool("manage_team_collaboration", {
    "project": project,
    "features": ["version_control", "task_assignment", "progress_tracking"],
    "communication": "integrated_chat"
})
```

### 4. Industry Standards Training

**Scenario**: Teach professional CAD standards and best practices

**Steps**:
1. Load industry-standard templates and guidelines
2. Provide automated compliance checking
3. Generate examples following best practices
4. Create certification-ready training modules

**Example**:
```python
# Load industry standards
standards_training = mcp_client.call_tool("load_industry_standards", {
    "industries": ["mechanical", "architectural", "electrical"],
    "standards": ["ASME_Y14.5", "AIA_LayerGuidelines", "IEEE_315"],
    "certification": "solidworks_associate"
})

# Check compliance
compliance_check = mcp_client.call_tool("check_standards_compliance", {
    "drawing": "student_mechanical_drawing.dwg",
    "standard": "ASME_Y14.5",
    "check_items": ["dimensions", "tolerances", "symbols", "notes"]
})
```
