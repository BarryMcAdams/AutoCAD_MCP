# Product Design Use Cases

This guide covers how to use the AutoCAD MCP Server for product design and development workflows.

## ðŸŽ¨ Product Design Workflows

### 1. Rapid Prototyping from Concepts

**Scenario**: Transform design sketches and concepts into 3D models for prototyping

**Steps**:
1. Import concept sketches or 2D profiles
2. Use AI-powered geometry recognition to extract design intent
3. Generate 3D models with parametric controls
4. Prepare models for 3D printing or CNC manufacturing

**Example**:
```python
# Convert sketch to 3D model
prototype = mcp_client.call_tool("sketch_to_3d", {
    "sketch_file": "product_concept.dwg",
    "extrusion_method": "adaptive",
    "design_intent": "consumer_electronics",
    "target_manufacturing": "injection_molding"
})

# Optimize for 3D printing
print_ready = mcp_client.call_tool("optimize_for_manufacturing", {
    "model": prototype,
    "process": "fdm_printing",
    "material": "pla",
    "resolution": 0.2
})
```

### 2. Ergonomic Analysis and Optimization

**Scenario**: Analyze and optimize product designs for human factors

**Steps**:
1. Import product geometry and define interaction points
2. Load anthropometric data for target user population
3. Perform ergonomic analysis using built-in tools
4. Generate design recommendations for improvement

**Example**:
```python
# Perform ergonomic analysis
ergonomic_study = mcp_client.call_tool("ergonomic_analysis", {
    "product_model": "handheld_device",
    "interaction_points": ["grip_areas", "button_locations", "display_angle"],
    "user_population": "95th_percentile_male",
    "analysis_type": "comfort_assessment"
})

# Generate design improvements
improvements = mcp_client.call_tool("optimize_ergonomics", {
    "current_design": "handheld_device",
    "ergonomic_data": ergonomic_study,
    "constraints": {"max_size": [150, 80, 25], "min_button_size": 8}
})
```

### 3. Design for Manufacturing (DFM) Analysis

**Scenario**: Optimize product designs for specific manufacturing processes

**Steps**:
1. Analyze current design for manufacturability issues
2. Identify problematic features and suggest alternatives
3. Estimate manufacturing costs and cycle times
4. Generate manufacturing-optimized design variants

**Example**:
```python
# Analyze for injection molding
dfm_analysis = mcp_client.call_tool("dfm_analysis", {
    "product": "plastic_housing",
    "manufacturing_process": "injection_molding",
    "material": "abs_plastic",
    "production_volume": 10000
})

# Optimize design for manufacturing
optimized_design = mcp_client.call_tool("optimize_for_manufacturing", {
    "original_design": "plastic_housing",
    "dfm_recommendations": dfm_analysis,
    "cost_target": "reduce_15_percent"
})
```

### 4. Assembly Design and Validation

**Scenario**: Design complex assemblies with automatic interference checking

**Steps**:
1. Create individual components with parametric relationships
2. Define assembly constraints and relationships
3. Perform interference detection and clearance analysis
4. Generate assembly instructions and bill of materials

**Example**:
```python
# Create parametric assembly
assembly = mcp_client.call_tool("create_parametric_assembly", {
    "components": ["housing", "motor", "gears", "fasteners"],
    "relationships": {
        "motor": {"constraint": "concentric", "reference": "housing_bore"},
        "gears": {"constraint": "mesh", "ratio": 4.5}
    }
})

# Check for interferences
interference_check = mcp_client.call_tool("interference_analysis", {
    "assembly": assembly,
    "tolerance_analysis": True,
    "motion_simulation": True,
    "clearance_requirements": {"minimum": 0.5, "preferred": 2.0}
})
```
