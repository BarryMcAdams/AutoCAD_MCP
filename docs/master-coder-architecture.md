## API Design Principles

### Additive Enhancement Pattern
New MCP tools follow consistent naming and behavior:

```python
# Existing manufacturing tools (PRESERVED)
@mcp.tool()
def unfold_surface(entity_id: int, tolerance: float = 0.01) -> str:
    # Manufacturing functionality unchanged

# New development tools (ADDITIVE)
@mcp.tool()  
def execute_python_in_autocad(code: str, context: str = "global") -> str:
    # Interactive development functionality

@mcp.tool()
def inspect_autocad_object(object_id: int, depth: str = "basic") -> str:
    # Object inspection functionality

@mcp.tool()
def generate_autolisp_script(task_description: str, complexity: str = "basic") -> str:
    # Code generation functionality
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: New features fail safely without affecting manufacturing tools
- **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed error information with suggested solutions
- **Logging Separation**: New features log to separate channels for troubleshooting

### Performance Considerations
- **Non-Blocking**: Interactive tools don't interfere with manufacturing workflows
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU usage monitored and controlled
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed AutoCAD objects

## Security Architecture
