# How-To: Mock AutoCAD System (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This feature provides you with a "practice mode" for the AutoCAD MCP Server. Think of it like a flight simulator for AutoCAD. It allows you to test out your new AI-powered tools without having to worry about messing up your real drawings.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you've created a new AI-powered tool that automatically deletes all of the blocks in a drawing. Before you use this tool on a real drawing, you can use the mock AutoCAD system to test it out and make sure that it works as expected.

**Who Should Use This:**
*   Anyone who wants to test out their new AI-powered tools before using them on real drawings.
*   Anyone who wants to learn how to use the AutoCAD MCP Server without having to worry about making mistakes.

**Who Should Skip This:**
*   If you are already comfortable with the AutoCAD MCP Server and you are not worried about making mistakes, you may not find this feature to be very useful.

## Before You Start - What You Need

### Physical Requirements:
*   Your computer with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD MCP Server installed.

### Knowledge Check:
✅ You should be comfortable with:
*   The basic concepts of the AutoCAD MCP Server.

❌ You do NOT need to know:
*   Anything about coding or programming.

### Time Investment:
*   5-10 minutes

## Mock AutoCAD System

### Using the Mock AutoCAD System

To use the mock AutoCAD system, you first need to tell the AI that you want to enter "practice mode."

`"I want to enter practice mode."`

The AI will then switch to the mock AutoCAD system. You can then use all of the same commands that you would use in the real AutoCAD MCP Server, but they will be executed in the mock system instead of the real AutoCAD.

### Exiting the Mock AutoCAD System

To exit the mock AutoCAD system, you simply need to tell the AI that you want to exit "practice mode."

`"I want to exit practice mode."`

The AI will then switch back to the real AutoCAD MCP Server.

## Advanced Usage

As you get more comfortable with the mock AutoCAD system, you can start to use it to test more complex scenarios.

`"I want to enter practice mode. Then, I want to create a new drawing and add a few lines and circles to it. Finally, I want to save the drawing and exit practice mode."`

The AI will then perform all of these actions in the mock system. You can then check the mock system to make sure that the drawing was created and saved correctly.

## Troubleshooting

*   **The AI doesn't understand my command:**
    *   Try to be as clear and specific as possible in your commands.
    *   If you're still having trouble, you can try to break your command down into smaller, simpler steps.
*   **The mock system doesn't behave as expected:**
    *   If the mock system doesn't behave as expected, you can try to rephrase your command to be more specific.
    *   You can also ask the AI to explain what it is doing in the mock system.

## Verification

To verify that the mock AutoCAD system is working correctly, you can perform a series of actions in the mock system and then check to make sure that the mock system is in the expected state.
