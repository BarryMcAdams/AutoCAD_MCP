# How-To: Pattern Optimization

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the pattern optimization features of the AutoCAD MCP Server. These features allow you to optimize the layout of 2D patterns to minimize material waste.

## Prerequisites

*   AutoCAD MCP Server installed and running.
*   An MCP client connected to the server.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Optimizing a Pattern Layout

To optimize a pattern layout, use the `optimize_pattern_layout()` tool. This tool takes one argument: a list of the 2D patterns to be laid out.

```python
client.optimize_pattern_layout([pattern1, pattern2, pattern3])
```

The server will then use its pattern optimization engine to find the optimal layout for the patterns. The resulting layout will be returned to the client.

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced pattern optimization, you can use the `optimize_pattern_layout_with_options()` tool. This tool allows you to specify a number of options for the optimization process, such as the optimization algorithm and the desired level of accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Invalid Patterns:** If you are getting errors about invalid patterns, make sure that you are providing valid 2D patterns to the `optimize_pattern_layout()` tool.
*   **Optimization Failed:** If the optimization process fails, you can try to use a different optimization algorithm or adjust the optimization options.

## Verification

To verify that the pattern optimization is working correctly, you can open the resulting layout in AutoCAD and check that it is a valid and optimal layout for the patterns.
