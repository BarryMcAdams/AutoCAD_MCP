# How-To: Basic Drawing Operations (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This guide will show you how to use the AI to perform basic drawing operations in AutoCAD. Think of it like using the command line in AutoCAD, but instead of typing commands, you'll be typing plain-English sentences.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you need to draw a series of circles. Instead of clicking the circle button and then entering the center and radius for each circle, you can just type:

`"Draw a circle at (0,0) with a radius of 5. Then, draw another circle at (10,10) with a radius of 10."`

The AI will then draw both circles for you, instantly.

**Who Should Use This:**
*   Anyone who wants to learn how to use the AI to create and modify drawings in AutoCAD.

**Who Should Skip This:**
*   If you are already comfortable with the basic drawing operations, you can skip this guide.

## Before You Start - What You Need

### Physical Requirements:
*   Your computer with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD MCP Server installed.

### Knowledge Check:
✅ You should be comfortable with:
*   The basic drawing concepts in AutoCAD (lines, circles, etc.).

❌ You do NOT need to know:
*   Anything about coding or programming.

### Time Investment:
*   10-15 minutes

## Basic Drawing Operations

### Creating Geometric Shapes

**Creating a Line:**

To create a line, simply tell the AI where you want the line to start and end.

`"Draw a line from (0,0) to (100,100)."`

**Creating a Circle:**

To create a circle, tell the AI where you want the center of the circle to be and what you want the radius to be.

`"Draw a circle at (50,50) with a radius of 25."`

**Creating a Rectangle:**

To create a rectangle, tell the AI where you want the corners of the rectangle to be.

`"Draw a rectangle with corners at (10,10) and (50,50)."`

### Text and Annotation Tools

**Adding Text:**

To add text to your drawing, simply tell the AI what you want the text to say and where you want it to be.

`"Add the text 'Hello, world!' at (20,20)."`

### Layer Management

**Creating a Layer:**

To create a new layer, simply tell the AI what you want the name of the layer to be.

`"Create a new layer named 'My Layer'."`

**Setting the Current Layer:**

To set the current layer, simply tell the AI what you want the current layer to be.

`"Set the current layer to 'My Layer'."`

## Advanced Usage

As you get more comfortable with the basic drawing operations, you can start to combine them into more complex commands.

`"Create a new layer named 'My Layer', set it as the current layer, and then draw a circle at (0,0) with a radius of 10."`

The AI will then perform all of these actions in sequence.

## Troubleshooting

*   **The AI doesn't understand my command:**
    *   Try to be as clear and specific as possible in your commands.
    *   If you're still having trouble, you can try to break your command down into smaller, simpler steps.
*   **The AI does something unexpected:**
    *   If the AI does something you didn't expect, you can use the `undo` command in AutoCAD to undo the action.
    *   You can then try to rephrase your command to be more specific.

## Verification

To verify that the drawing operations are working correctly, you can open the drawing in AutoCAD and check that the objects have been created as expected.
