# How-To: Deployment Automation

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the deployment automation features of the AutoCAD MCP Server. These features allow you to streamline the deployment of your AutoCAD automation scripts.

## Prerequisites

*   AutoCAD MCP Server installed and running.
*   An MCP client connected to the server.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Deploying an Automation Script

To deploy an automation script, use the `deploy_script()` tool. This tool takes two arguments: the script to be deployed, and the target environment.

```python
client.deploy_script(my_script, "production")
```

The server will then deploy the script to the specified environment. The deployment process may include steps such as installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and starting the script.

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced deployment automation, you can use the `deploy_script_with_options()` tool. This tool allows you to specify a number of options for the deployment process, such as the deployment strategy and the desired level of logging.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Invalid Script:** If you are getting errors about an invalid script, make sure that you are providing a valid script to the `deploy_script()` tool.
*   **Deployment Failed:** If the deployment process fails, you can check the deployment logs for more information.

## Verification

To verify that the deployment automation is working correctly, you can check that the script has been deployed to the specified environment and that it is running as expected.
