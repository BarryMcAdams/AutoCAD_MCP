# How-To: Parametric Design (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This feature allows you to create "smart" 3D models that can be easily modified. Think of it like using dynamic blocks, but for 3D models. You can define a set of rules, and the model will automatically update when you change the rules.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you're designing a cabinet. With parametric design, you can create a single model and then easily change the height, width, and depth to create different versions of the cabinet. You don't have to redraw the cabinet every time you want to make a change.

**Who Should Use This:**
*   Anyone who wants to create flexible and adaptable 3D models.
*   Anyone who wants to save time when creating multiple versions of a design.

**Who Should Skip This:**
*   If you only create simple, one-off designs, you may not find this feature to be very useful.

## Before You Start - What You Need

### Physical Requirements:
*   Your computer with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD MCP Server installed.

### Knowledge Check:
✅ You should be comfortable with:
*   The basic 3D modeling concepts in AutoCAD.

❌ You do NOT need to know:
*   Anything about coding or programming.

### Time Investment:
*   15-20 minutes

## Parametric Design

### Creating a Parametric Model

To create a parametric model, you first need to tell the AI what you want to create and what the rules are.

`"Create a parametric model of a box. The height should be twice the width, and the depth should be half the width."`

The AI will then create a "smart" box that follows these rules. You can then easily change the width of the box, and the height and depth will automatically update.

### Modifying a Parametric Model

To modify a parametric model, you simply need to tell the AI what you want to change.

`"Change the width of the box to 20."`

The AI will then update the model to reflect the new width, and the height and depth will be automatically updated as well.

## Advanced Usage

As you get more comfortable with parametric design, you can start to create more complex models with more complex rules.

`"Create a parametric model of a bookshelf. The user should be able to specify the number of shelves, the height of the shelves, and the depth of the shelves."`

The AI will then create a bookshelf that can be easily customized by changing these parameters.

## Troubleshooting

*   **The AI doesn't understand my command:**
    *   Try to be as clear and specific as possible in your commands.
    *   If you're still having trouble, you can try to break your command down into smaller, simpler steps.
*   **The model doesn't update correctly:**
    *   If the model doesn't update correctly, you can try to rephrase your command to be more specific.
    *   You can also ask the AI to explain the rules that are governing the model.

## Verification

To verify that the parametric design is working correctly, you can change the parameters of the model and check that it updates as expected.
