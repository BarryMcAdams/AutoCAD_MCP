# How-To: Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides troubleshooting information for the AutoCAD MCP Server. It covers common problems and their solutions.

## Common Problems

### Connection Errors

If you are having trouble connecting to the server, make sure that the server is running and that you are using the correct host and port.

### AutoCAD Errors

If you are getting errors from AutoCAD, make sure that you have the correct version of AutoCAD installed and that it is running properly.

### Invalid Coordinates

If you are getting errors about invalid coordinates, make sure that you are using valid numbers for the coordinates.

### Layer Not Found

If you are getting errors about a layer not being found, make sure that the layer exists in the current drawing.

### Invalid Description

If you are getting errors about an invalid description, make sure that you are providing a clear and concise description of the task you want to perform.

### Code Generation Failed

If the code generation fails, you can try to rephrase your description or provide more detail.

### No Recommendations Found

If no recommendations are found, you can try to rephrase your description or provide more detail.

### Invalid Surface

If you are getting errors about an invalid surface, make sure that you are providing a valid 3D surface to the `unfold_surface()` tool.

### Unfolding Failed

If the unfolding process fails, you can try to use a different unfolding method or adjust the unfolding options.

### Invalid Parameters

If you are getting errors about invalid parameters, make sure that you are using valid values for the parameters.

### Model Not Updating

If the model is not updating when you change the parameter values, make sure that the model is properly constrained to the parameters.

### Invalid Patterns

If you are getting errors about invalid patterns, make sure that you are providing valid 2D patterns to the `optimize_pattern_layout()` tool.

### Optimization Failed

If the optimization process fails, you can try to use a different optimization algorithm or adjust the optimization options.

### Invalid Script

If you are getting errors about an invalid script, make sure that you are providing a valid script to the `deploy_script()` tool.

### Deployment Failed

If the deployment process fails, you can check the deployment logs for more information.

### Mock System Not Enabled

If you are not seeing the expected behavior from the mock system, make sure that it is enabled in the server configuration.

### Invalid Mock API Calls

If you are getting errors about invalid mock API calls, make sure that you are using the mock API correctly.
