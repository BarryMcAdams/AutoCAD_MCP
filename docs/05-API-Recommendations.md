# How-To: API Recommendations (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This feature allows the AI to suggest the best AutoCAD commands for a task. Think of it like having an AutoCAD expert sitting next to you, ready to give you advice on the most efficient way to do your work.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you need to find all of the blocks in a drawing. You could manually go through the drawing and select each block, but that would be time-consuming. Instead, you can ask the AI for the best way to do it, and it will tell you to use the `BCOUNT` command.

**Who Should Use This:**
*   Anyone who wants to learn new and more efficient ways to use AutoCAD.
*   Anyone who is not sure what the best command is for a particular task.

**Who Should Skip This:**
*   If you are already an AutoCAD expert, you may not find this feature to be very useful.

## Before You Start - What You Need

### Physical Requirements:
*   Your computer with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD MCP Server installed.

### Knowledge Check:
✅ You should be comfortable with:
*   The basic drawing concepts in AutoCAD.

❌ You do NOT need to know:
*   Anything about coding or programming.

### Time Investment:
*   5-10 minutes

## API Recommendations

### Getting API Recommendations

To get API recommendations, simply ask the AI for the best way to do a particular task.

`"What is the best way to find all of the blocks in a drawing?"`

The AI will then suggest the most efficient AutoCAD command for the task and provide you with an example of how to use it.

## Advanced Usage

As you get more comfortable with API recommendations, you can start to ask more complex questions.

`"What is the most efficient way to create a 3D model of a house, including the walls, roof, and windows?"`

The AI will then provide you with a step-by-step guide to creating the model, including the best commands to use for each step.

## Troubleshooting

*   **The AI doesn't understand my question:**
    *   Try to be as clear and specific as possible in your question.
    *   If you're still having trouble, you can try to break your question down into smaller, simpler steps.
*   **The AI gives me a bad recommendation:**
    *   If the AI gives you a bad recommendation, you can try to rephrase your question to be more specific.
    *   You can also ask the AI to explain why it gave you that recommendation.

## Verification

To verify that the API recommendations are working correctly, you can try to use the recommended commands in AutoCAD and check that they perform the specified task as expected.
