This roadmap structures development into phases, with estimated timelines assuming AI-assisted coding.

- **Phase 0: Completed (Foundation Setup)**:
  - Install Agent OS and customize standards.
  - Analyze existing codebase (if any) via @analyze-product.

- **Phase 1: Core MCP Server (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Implement server architecture with pyautocad integration.
  - Basic 2D/3D operations (drawing primitives, entity manipulation).
  - Testing framework.

- **Phase 2: Advanced 3D Features (2-3 weeks)**:
  - 3D solid/surface modeling and Boolean operations.
  - Unfolding utility for double-curvature surfaces.
  - Layout and auto-dimensioning utility.

- **Phase 3: Plugin Framework and Integrations (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Modular plugin system with GUI inputs.
  - VS Code client library and extension compatibility.

- **Phase 4: Optimization and Deployment (1 week)**:
  - Performance tuning, error handling.
  - Documentation and example scripts.

- **Phase 5: Future Enhancements**:
  - NLP integration for natural language commands.
  - Multi-user support.

Review and update after each phase based on refinements.
