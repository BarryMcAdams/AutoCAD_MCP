# README First: An AutoCAD User's Guide to AI-Powered Drafting

## What This Is, and Why You Should Care

Imagine you're at your desk, working on a complex drawing. You have a tedious task ahead of you, like unfolding a complex 3D shape into a 2D pattern for manufacturing. It's going to take you hours of manual work, and you're not looking forward to it.

Now, what if you could just type a sentence into a chat window, like you're talking to a colleague, and have that task done for you in seconds? That's what this project is all about.

The AutoCAD MCP Server is a tool that connects your AutoCAD software to a powerful AI. This allows you to use simple, plain-English commands to automate your work, saving you time and effort.

## How It Works (In a Nutshell)

You won't need to learn any code. You won't need to open any command prompts. You'll just use a simple chat window to tell the AI what you want to do, and the AI will do it for you in AutoCAD.

Think of it like having a super-smart assistant who knows everything about AutoCAD and can do any task you ask, instantly.

## What You'll Find in This Documentation

This documentation is designed for you, the experienced AutoCAD drafter. It's written in plain English, with no technical jargon. It will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from installation to your first successful AI-powered drawing.

Here's what you'll find:

*   **01-Installation-Setup.md:** A step-by-step guide to installing the software, just like you would install any other AutoCAD add-on.
*   **02-Your-First-Success.md:** A simple, 5-minute test to make sure everything is working correctly.
*   **03-Basic-Drawing-Operations.md:** Learn how to use the AI to create simple shapes, add text, and manage layers.
*   **04-AI-Code-Generation.md:** Discover how the AI can write simple scripts for you.
*   **05-API-Recommendations.md:** Learn how the AI can suggest the best AutoCAD commands for a task.
*   **06-3D-Surface-Unfolding.md:** A deep dive into one of the most powerful features of the AutoCAD MCP Server.
*   **07-Parametric-Design.md:** Understand how to create smart, adaptable models with AI.
*   **08-Pattern-Optimization.md:** See how the AI can help you save material and money.
*   **09-Deployment-Automation.md:** Learn how to share your new AI-powered tools with colleagues.
*   **10-Mock-AutoCAD-System.md:** A guide to the built-in "practice mode."
*   **11-Troubleshooting-Guide.md:** A guide to help you solve any problems you might encounter.
