# How-To: Deployment Automation (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This feature helps you to share your new AI-powered tools with your colleagues. Think of it like creating a custom AutoCAD command and then sharing it with your team. It allows you to package up your new tools and make them available to everyone in your office.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you've created a new AI-powered tool that automatically unfolds a specific type of 3D model. You can use deployment automation to package up this tool and share it with your colleagues. They can then use the tool without having to know anything about how it was created.

**Who Should Use This:**
*   Anyone who wants to share their new AI-powered tools with their colleagues.
*   Anyone who wants to standardize the way that their team uses AutoCAD.

**Who Should Skip This:**
*   If you are the only person who will be using your new AI-powered tools, you may not find this feature to be very useful.

## Before You Start - What You Need

### Physical Requirements:
*   Your computer with AutoCAD and the AutoCAD MCP Server installed.

### Knowledge Check:
✅ You should be comfortable with:
*   The basic concepts of sharing files on a network.

❌ You do NOT need to know:
*   Anything about coding or programming.

### Time Investment:
*   10-15 minutes

## Deployment Automation

### Deploying an AI-Powered Tool

To deploy an AI-powered tool, you first need to tell the AI what tool you want to deploy and where you want to deploy it.

`"I have created a new AI-powered tool that automatically unfolds a specific type of 3D model. Please package up this tool and make it available to everyone on my team."`

The AI will then package up the tool and provide you with a file that you can share with your colleagues. They can then install the tool on their own computers and start using it right away.

## Advanced Usage

As you get more comfortable with deployment automation, you can start to specify more advanced options.

`"I have created a new AI-powered tool that automatically unfolds a specific type of 3D model. Please package up this tool and make it available to everyone on my team. Also, please create a user guide that explains how to use the tool."`

The AI will then package up the tool and create a user guide for you. You can then share both the tool and the user guide with your colleagues.

## Troubleshooting

*   **The AI doesn't understand my command:**
    *   Try to be as clear and specific as possible in your commands.
    *   If you're still having trouble, you can try to break your command down into smaller, simpler steps.
*   **The deployed tool doesn't work:**
    *   If the deployed tool doesn't work, you can try to rephrase your command to be more specific.
    *   You can also ask the AI to debug the tool for you.

## Verification

To verify that the deployment automation is working correctly, you can have a colleague install the deployed tool and check that it works as expected.
