## ✨ Overview

This **AutoCAD MCP Server** is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to assist my AutoCAD development and manufacturing workflows. This advanced system integrates cutting-edge AI capabilities with AutoCAD 2025, providing developers and engineers with powerful tools for automation, code generation, and intelligent design assistance. 

Built with **Python 3.12** and leveraging **Flask 3.0**, this mcp server was made to turn some of my traditional CAD processes into intelligent, automated workflows that enhance productivity and innovation across the manufacturing and design industries.

### 🎯 Target Audience

**TARGET AUDIENCE:** CAD and code programming professionals involved in engineering, manufacturing, and architecture using AutoCAD 2025 on Windows, who may want to author custom utilities for 3D-to-2D transformations and presentation automation.

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🤖 **AI-Powered Development** | Use natural language to generate Python and AutoLISP scripts, get API recommendations, and even predict errors before they happen. |
| 🏭 **Advanced Manufacturing** | Automate complex tasks like 3D surface unfolding, parametric design, and pattern optimization for maximum material efficiency. |
| 🏢 **Enterprise Ready** | Built for professional teams with features like multi-user collaboration, security monitoring, and deployment automation. |
| 🛠️ **Developer Tools** | A comprehensive development framework with a mock AutoCAD system for offline testing, performance benchmarking, and CI/CD integration. |

## 🔧 Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Windows 10/11** (Required for AutoCAD COM integration)
- **AutoCAD 2021-2025** installed and licensed
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Poetry** or **UV** package manager (recommended)

### Development Environment
- This project can be developed on Linux/WSL2 for code editing and testing
- Full functionality requires Windows deployment for AutoCAD integration
- Cross-platform testing uses mock implementations for Windows-only components

## 🚀 Getting Started

We have two main guides to help you get started, depending on your background:

### For AutoCAD Drafters (No Coding Experience)

If you're an AutoCAD user who wants to use AI to automate your work, we have a set of detailed, non-technical guides for you. Start here:

➡️ **[The AutoCAD Drafter's Guide to Installation & Setup](./docs/01-Installation-Setup.md)**

### For Developers

If you're a developer who wants to build on top of the AutoCAD MCP Server, you can get started with the following steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BarryMcAdams/AutoCAD_MCP.git
    cd AutoCAD_MCP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    
    **Option A: Using Poetry (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    
    **Option B: Using UV**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    
    **Option C: Using pip** 
    ```bash
    # First generate requirements.txt from pyproject.toml
    pip install -e .
    ```

3.  **Run the server:**
    
    **With Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry run python src/mcp_server.py
    ```
    
    **With UV:**
    ```bash
    uv run python src/mcp_server.py
    ```
    
    **Direct Python:**
    ```bash
    python src/mcp_server.py
    ```

For more detailed information, please refer to the [developer documentation](./docs/README.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The AutoCAD MCP Server is built on a modular and scalable architecture. It uses a powerful Python wrapper to communicate with the AutoCAD COM API, and a flexible MCP server framework to expose the AI-powered tools. This design allows for easy extension and integration with other systems.
