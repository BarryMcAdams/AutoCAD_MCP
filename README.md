## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps!)

### Prerequisites
- **AutoCAD 2025** (full version) installed and activated
- **Python 3.12+** 
- **Windows OS** (required for AutoCAD COM interface)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Claude Desktop Integration (Most Popular)

1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BarryMcAdams/AutoCAD_MCP.git
   cd AutoCAD_MCP
   uv sync  # or: poetry install
   ```

2. **Add to Claude Desktop MCP Configuration**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "autocad-mcp": {
         "command": "./.venv/Scripts/python.exe",
         "args": ["src/server.py"],
         "cwd": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\AutoCAD_MCP"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start Creating!**
   - Launch AutoCAD 2025 with a drawing open
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Say: *"Check AutoCAD connection and draw a line from origin to (100,100,0)"*

#### Option 2: Claude Code CLI (Perfect for Developers!)

**Ideal for VS Code + WSL Development Workflow:**

1. **Setup in WSL Terminal (inside VS Code)**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BarryMcAdams/AutoCAD_MCP.git
   cd AutoCAD_MCP
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Add MCP Server**
   ```bash
   claude mcp add autocad-mcp ./.venv/Scripts/python.exe src/server.py
   ```

3. **Start Coding with AI**
   ```bash
   # In VS Code terminal (WSL)
   claude
   # Then: "Draw a complex 3D building structure with parametric dimensions"
   ```

**Why Claude Code CLI + WSL?**
- ✅ **Perfect Development Flow**: Code, test, and create in one environment
- ✅ **Natural Integration**: AutoCAD automation directly in your development workflow  
- ✅ **Instant Testing**: Generate and test AutoCAD scripts without switching contexts
- ✅ **Version Control**: All your AI-generated CAD automation is tracked in git
