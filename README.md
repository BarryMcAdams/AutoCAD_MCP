## ‚ú® Overview

This **AutoCAD MCP Server** is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to assist my AutoCAD development and manufacturing workflows. This advanced system integrates cutting-edge AI capabilities with AutoCAD 2025, providing developers and engineers with powerful tools for automation, code generation, and intelligent design assistance. 

Built with **Python 3.12** and leveraging **Flask 3.0**, this mcp server was made to turn some of my traditional CAD processes into intelligent, automated workflows that enhance productivity and innovation across the manufacturing and design industries.

### üéØ Target Audience

**TARGET AUDIENCE:** CAD and code programming professionals involved in engineering, manufacturing, and architecture using AutoCAD 2025 on Windows, who may want to author custom utilities for 3D-to-2D transformations and presentation automation.

## üåü Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ü§ñ **AI-Powered Development** | Use natural language to generate Python and AutoLISP scripts, get API recommendations, and even predict errors before they happen. |
| üè≠ **Advanced Manufacturing** | Automate complex tasks like 3D surface unfolding, parametric design, and pattern optimization for maximum material efficiency. |
| üè¢ **Enterprise Ready** | Built for professional teams with features like multi-user collaboration, security monitoring, and deployment automation. |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Tools** | A comprehensive development framework with a mock AutoCAD system for offline testing, performance benchmarking, and CI/CD integration. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

We have two main guides to help you get started, depending on your background:

### For AutoCAD Drafters (No Coding Experience)

If you're an AutoCAD user who wants to use AI to automate your work, we have a set of detailed, non-technical guides for you. Start here:

‚û°Ô∏è **[The AutoCAD Drafter's Guide to Installation & Setup](./docs/01-Installation-Setup.md)**

### For Developers

If you're a developer who wants to build on top of the AutoCAD MCP Server, you can get started with the following steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BarryMcAdams/AutoCAD_MCP.git
    cd AutoCAD_MCP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    python src/mcp_server.py
    ```

For more detailed information, please refer to the [developer documentation](./docs/README.md).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The AutoCAD MCP Server is built on a modular and scalable architecture. It uses a powerful Python wrapper to communicate with the AutoCAD COM API, and a flexible MCP server framework to expose the AI-powered tools. This design allows for easy extension and integration with other systems.
