# Session Handoff: August 7, 2025

This session focused on a comprehensive, non-destructive evaluation of the project, followed by a significant cleanup and validation phase. The primary goal was to prepare the codebase for the implementation of the comprehensive testing expansion plan.

## Accomplishments

1.  **Project Cleanup:**
    *   Identified and moved a redundant server (`src/mcp_server.py`) and several brittle validation scripts (`validate_*.py`) to the `DELETED` directory, clarifying the project's true entry point.
    *   Decluttered the root directory by moving all documentation into the `docs` folder.
    *   Reorganized the `docs` folder with a logical subdirectory structure and removed confusing numeric prefixes from filenames.

2.  **Test Suite Creation and Validation:**
    *   Identified that the key test file, `test_mcp_advanced_tools.py`, was missing.
    *   Created the `test_mcp_advanced_tools.py` file from scratch, using `validate_mcp_tests.py` as a blueprint for the required structure.
    *   Implemented a full suite of unit tests for the advanced `unfold_surface_lscm` tool in `src/server.py`.

3.  **Bug Fix and Verification:**
    *   Ran the newly created tests and discovered a `NameError` bug in `src/server.py`.
    *   Corrected the bug (a `false` vs. `False` typo).
    *   Reran the tests and confirmed that all 6 tests now pass, validating the health of the core server logic.

## Current State

The project is now in a significantly cleaner and more robust state. The codebase is organized, the primary entry point is clear, and the advanced algorithmic tooling is covered by a passing unit test suite.

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Comprehensive Testing Expansion:**
    *   With the unit tests for the advanced tools in place, the next step is to execute the full **Comprehensive Testing Expansion Plan**.
    *   This involves running the integration, performance, and regression test suites against the cleaned codebase to ensure enterprise-level stability and scalability.

2.  **Address NumPy Deprecation Warning:**
    *   The tests revealed a `DeprecationWarning` in `src/algorithms/lscm.py`. While not critical, a task should be created to address this to ensure future compatibility.

## Long-Range Plans

*   Continue with the **Phase 1 Implementation** as outlined in the project documentation, focusing on enterprise scalability and security, now that the core is validated.
*   Integrate the `unfold_surface_lscm` algorithm and other advanced features into the broader enterprise framework.
