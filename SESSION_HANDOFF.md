# Session Handoff Notes - AutoCAD MCP Project

**Date**: 2025-07-23 09:05  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (with 1 blocking issue)

## Immediate Next Steps for New Session

### 1. Fix COM Initialization (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File**: `src/utils.py`  
**Function**: `get_autocad_instance()`  
**Issue**: `[WinError -2147221008] CoInitialize has not been called`

**Fix Required**:
```python
import pythoncom

def get_autocad_instance():
    """Get AutoCAD instance with proper COM initialization."""
    try:
        pythoncom.CoInitialize()  # ADD THIS LINE
        acad = Autocad()
        return acad
    except Exception as e:
        # existing error handling...
```

### 2. Test the Fix
**Command**: `"C:\Users\barrya\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\autocad-mcp-lupfEvC3-py3.12\Scripts\python.exe" final_test.py`

**Expected Result**: All 4 tests should pass, creating line and circle in AutoCAD

### 3. Move to Phase 2
After successful test, implement 3D operations:
- POST /draw/extrude
- POST /draw/revolve  
- POST /draw/boolean-union
- POST /draw/boolean-subtract

## Project Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Complete project architecture and documentation
- All Phase 1 drawing endpoints (line, circle, polyline, rectangle)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit tests for all drawing operations
- Flask server with proper routing
- Dependencies installed via Poetry

### üîÑ Current Issue
- AutoCAD COM connection blocked by missing CoInitialize call
- Server runs fine, but can't connect to AutoCAD 2025

### ‚è≥ Next Phase
- Phase 2: 3D operations implementation
- Surface unfolding algorithms
- Layout auto-dimensioning

## Key Files for Reference

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Complete project documentation
2. **`src/server.py`** - Main Flask server (404 lines, fully implemented)
3. **`src/utils.py`** - Utilities including AutoCAD connection (needs COM fix)
4. **`final_test.py`** - Working test script for verification
5. **`pyproject.toml`** - All dependencies configured

## Working Commands

**Start Server**:
```bash
cd "C:\users\barrya\source\repos\autocad_mcp"
"C:\Users\barrya\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\autocad-mcp-lupfEvC3-py3.12\Scripts\python.exe" final_test.py
```

**Manual Server (for debugging)**:
```bash
"C:\Users\barrya\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\autocad-mcp-lupfEvC3-py3.12\Scripts\python.exe" run_server.py
```

## User Context
- User has AutoCAD 2025 running on Windows machine
- Project is for VS Code/Roo Code integration (NOT Claude desktop)
- User explicitly requested comprehensive documentation and dependency installation
- User expects Phase 1 completion before moving to Phase 2

## Recent Conversation Summary
User pointed out I said dependencies were installed yesterday but they weren't. I installed them properly via Poetry. User directed me to complete the promised 30-second AutoCAD test. I got the server running and discovered the COM initialization issue - everything else works perfectly.

**Critical**: The next Claude instance should immediately fix the COM issue and run the test to complete Phase 1 as promised to the user.
