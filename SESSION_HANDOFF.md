## 🎉 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE (2025-07-23 11:30)
- Basic AutoCAD operations (lines, circles, polylines, rectangles)
- Flask server operational on localhost:5001
- AutoCAD 2025 COM connection established
- All basic drawing endpoints functional

### ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE (2025-07-24 13:10)  
- 3D operations: extrude, revolve, boolean union/subtract
- AutoCAD connection targeting fixed (connects to active instance)
- All 3D operations verified working in correct AutoCAD instance

### ✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETE (2025-07-24 14:45)
**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Complete surface unfolding system implemented!

**Key Implementations:**
- **Surface Mesh Creation**: `POST /surface/3d-mesh` for rectangular grids
- **Surface Analysis Engine**: Coordinate-based dimension detection (3x3, 4x4, 5x5 grids)
- **Surface Unfolding Algorithm**: `POST /surface/unfold` with manufacturing data
- **Manufacturing Output**: Fold lines, material specs, pattern optimization

**Verified Working:**
- 3x3 mesh → 50x50 pattern with 4 fold lines, 60x60 material, 95% utilization
- 4x4 curved mesh → 75x75 pattern with advanced geometry
- Multiple surface types supported with <5% distortion tolerance

## 🚀 NEXT PHASE: PHASE 4 - Advanced CAD Utilities & Optimization

### Current Architecture

**Core Files:**
