# How-To: FAQ (For AutoCAD Drafters)

## What This Means for You (The AutoCAD User)

**In Plain English:** This guide provides answers to frequently asked questions about the AutoCAD MCP Server. It's a good place to start if you have a question that's not covered in the other guides.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is this thing, anyway?

Think of it as a super-smart assistant for your AutoCAD. It's a program that lets you talk to an AI in plain English, and the AI will then do the work for you in AutoCAD. You can use it to automate tedious tasks, create complex drawings, and even get help with your designs.

### Do I need to be a programmer to use this?

No! This project is designed for experienced AutoCAD drafters who have no coding experience. You don't need to know anything about programming, APIs, or command lines. All you need to know is how to use AutoCAD and how to type in a chat window.

### Is this going to take my job?

No. This is a tool to help you do your job better and faster. It's designed to automate the tedious and repetitive parts of your work, so you can focus on the creative and strategic parts. Think of it as a power tool for your brain.

### Is it safe? Will it mess up my drawings?

The server is designed to be as safe as possible. It doesn't modify your AutoCAD installation in any way, and it doesn't have access to any of your personal files. However, it's always a good idea to save your work before you use any new tool, just in case.

### What if I don't like what the AI does?

If the AI does something you don't like, you can use the `undo` command in AutoCAD to undo the action. You can then try to rephrase your command to be more specific.

### Where can I get help?

If you need help, the best place to start is the project's GitHub discussions. There, you can ask questions, report problems, and get help from the community.

### How much does it cost?

The AutoCAD MCP Server is free and open-source. You can use it for as long as you like, for any purpose you like.

### What's the catch?

There is no catch. This is a community-driven project that is designed to help AutoCAD users to be more productive and creative. We hope you'll join us in making it even better.
