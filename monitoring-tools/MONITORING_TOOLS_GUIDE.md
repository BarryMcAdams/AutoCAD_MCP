## Tool Compatibility

These tools are **completely compatible** and serve different purposes:

- **Sniffly**: Historical analysis and web-based insights
- **Claude Monitor**: Real-time monitoring and terminal-based tracking

Both tools:
- Run locally with no external dependencies
- Are privacy-focused
- Can be used simultaneously without conflicts
- Complement each other for comprehensive monitoring

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start Sniffly dashboard
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 sniffly init

# Start Claude Monitor in another terminal
claude-monitor
```

Both tools will run independently and provide different perspectives on your Claude Code usage.
