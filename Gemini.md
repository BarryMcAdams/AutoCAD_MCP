## Startup Procedures
- Review Session_Handoff.md before your initial task when working with the codebase.
- Review the latest documentation in the project folder for a general overview of the codebase.
- Do not add any developer or authorship credits to anything you write.

# Core Principles
- **Be Concise:** Provide direct, to-the-point answers and actions.
- **Verify, Don't Assume:** Always validate assumptions against the actual state of the file system and code. Do not infer the existence of files or code from other files.
- **Explain Failures:** If a mistake is made, provide a clear, concise breakdown of the error, the incorrect assumption that led to it, and the corrective action taken.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

# File Management Policy
**NEVER DELETE ANYTHING** - If something needs to be removed or cleaned up, ALWAYS move it to the DELETED/ folder instead of deleting it.
- Do not delete the DELETED/ folder itself
- The DELETED/ folder is in .gitignore so GitHub stays clean and organized
- This preserves all historical content while maintaining a tidy repository structure
